**Guidelines, overview of maintenance process, etc.**

_“Thou shall GPG-sign.”_

# Git config

## GPG signing

While contributors are suggested to use GPG, as a maintainer you **are
required** to use GPG to sign commits & merges.

If you don't have GPG signing set up yet, now is the moment to do it.

[Config, etc.](/CONTRIBUTING.md#git-config)

If a contributor does not sign their commits, then a maintainer must sign them
on their behalf.

## SSH

Preferably use SSH.

There are quite a few articles about that:
https://help.github.com/categories/ssh/

## Useful aliases

Check whether commits are GPG-signed with `git logs`

```
git config --global alias.logs 'log --show-signature'
```

# Commits

- **always** use [commit message format]
- **always** GPG-sign your commits.
- All changes must go through Pull Requests. Direct pushes to the `master`
  branch is not possible.

# Pull requests

- **do not** push any `Merge`, `Squash & Merge`, etc. buttons on the website.
  They won't sign commits and won't work.
- **always** test PR that is being merged.
- for a complicated PR, give it some "breathing space" right after it's created.
  Merging something right away can lead to bugs & regressions suddenly popping
  up, thus it's preferable to wait at least a day or so, to let people test &
  comment on the PR before merging.
  - with trivial changes, like fixing typos or something along those lines,
    feel free to merge right away.
- if a PR requires some changes, comment what parts need to be adjusted,
  preferably by using the `Reviewable` button on the first comment.
- if PR doesn't apply properly on top of current master, request a rebase.
- if a PR requires changes but there has been no activity from the PR submitter
  for more than 2 months, close the PR.

# Continuous Integration

All CI is done through GitHub actions. Nightly builds are published to
TokTok/qTox releases.

# Issues

## Tagging Issues

- When you request more info to be provided in the issue, tag it with
  `O-need-info`. Remove tag once the needed info has been provided.
  - If the needed information is not provided after 30 days, add the `O-stale`
    tag and a comment requesting the information again.
    - If the `O-stale` tag is present for more than 30 day, the issue should
      be closed.
- If you're going to fix the issue, assign yourself to it.
- when closing an issue, preferably state the reason why it was closed, unless
  it was closed automatically by commit message.
- When issue is a duplicate, close the issue with less useful information and
  comment the link to the other issue.

## Determining Priority

The priority of an issue should be determined by taking into account the user
impact and how hard it is to fix the issue.

### User impact

We have two labels to rate user impact `U-high` and `U-low`.

Use `U-high` if

- Many users have reported this issue
- The problem is triggered often during typical use of qTox
- The problem causes data loss
- There is no workaround

Use `U-low` if

- Few users reported this problem
- The problem occurs very sporadically
- The problem needs a very specific set of conditions to appear
- There is a workaround
- The problem appears only after multiple days of usage

### Difficulty to fix

We have two labels to estimate the difficulty of a fix, `D-easy` and `D-hard`.

Use `D-easy` if you think that:

- The issue is well described
- The issue can be consistently reproduced
- The issue needs no specific equipment to fix, e.g. specific OS, webcam,...
- The code that causes the problem is known

Use `D-hard` if you think that:

- The issue is described only vaguely
- The exact way to reproduce the issue is not known
- The issue happens only on a specific OS
- The issue is not only caused by code from qTox

### Determining initial priority

After assessing the user impact and the difficulty to fix the issue you look up
the initial priority for the issue in the following table:

|          | `U-high`   | `U-low`    |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| `E-easy` | `P-high`   | `P-medium` |
| `E-hard` | `P-medium` | `P-low`    |

Possible security issues should be tagged with `P-high` initially. If they are
confirmed security issues, the tag should be changed to `P-very-high`, else
apply the normal rating process.

# Translations from Weblate

Weblate provides an easy way for people to translate qTox.

New translatable strings need to be generated into a form Weblate can consume
using `./tools/update-translation-files.sh ALL` and committing the result. This
should be done as soon as strings are available since weblate follows our
branch, so is checked for in CI.

Weblate will make PRs to get translations into qTox, but if that fails, you can
manually fast-forward merge from https://hosted.weblate.org/git/qtox/qtox/.

If a new translation language has been added, update the following files:

- `translations/CMakeLists.txt`
- `src/widget/form/settings/generalform.cpp`
- `translations/README.md`
- `translations/i18n.pri`
- `translations/translations.qrc`

# Releases

## Tagging scheme

- tag versions that are to be released, make sure that they are GPG-signed,
  i.e. `git tag -s v1.8.0`
- use semantic versions for tags: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
  - `MAJOR` – bump version when there are breaking changes to video, audio,
    text chats, conferences, file transfers, and any other basic functionality.
    For other things, `MINOR` and `PATCH` are to be bumped.
  - `MINOR` – bump version when there are:
    - new features added
    - UI/feature breaking changes
    - other non-breaking changes
  - `PATCH` – bump when there have been only fixes added. If changes include
    something more than just bugfixes, bump `MAJOR` or `MINOR` version
    accordingly.
- bumping a higher-level version "resets" lower-version numbers, e.g.
  `v1.7.1 → v2.0.0`

## Steps for release

These steps are the same for a full release and a pre-release (i.e. release
candidates).

### Step 1. Create a release PR

Most of these steps are automated by [`.ci-scripts/validate-pr.py`], which you
can run locally to automate the pre-tagging process.

- Merge any Weblate PRs if they are still open.
- Create a new release PR branch, e.g.: `git checkout -b 1.18.0-rc.3`.

**Automated method:**

- Run `.ci-scripts/validate-pr.py`.

**Manual method:**

- Update the local Flatpak manifest with the script in [`flatpak/update_flathub_descriptor_dependencies.py`]
  - Make sure to check if new dependencies need to be added, add them if necessary
- Update toxcore version number to the latest tag in
  [`dockerfiles/qtox/download/download_toxcore.sh`](https://github.com/TokTok/dockerfiles/blob/master/qtox/download/download_toxcore.sh)
- Update version number for windows/macos packages using the
  [`tools/update-versions.sh`] script, e.g.
  `tools/update-versions.sh 1.11.0` (don't add the `v` in `v1.11.0`)
- Update the bootstrap nodelist at `res/nodes.json` from https://nodes.tox.chat/json.
  This can be done by running [`tools/update-nodes.sh`]
- Generate changelog with `clog`.
  - In a `MAJOR`/`MINOR` release tag should include information that changelog
    is located in the `CHANGELOG.md` file, e.g. `For details see CHANGELOG.md`
- To release a `PATCH` version after non-fix changes have landed on `master`
  branch, checkout latest `MAJOR`/`MINOR` version and `git cherry-pick -x`
  commits from `master` that you want `PATCH` release to include. Once
  cherry-picking has been done, tag HEAD of the branch.
  - When making a `PATCH` tag, include in tag message short summary of what the
    tag release fixes, and to whom it's interesting (often only some
    OSes/distributions would find given `PATCH` release interesting).

### Step 2. Prepare the binary and source release

In the PRs in this step, only make pull requests. Do not merge, yet.

- Create and GPG-sign the tar.lz and tar.gz archives using
  [`tools/create-tarballs.sh`] script, and upload both archives plus both
  signature files to the github draft release that was created by CI.
- Download the binaries that are part of the draft release, sign them in
  in detached and ascii armored mode, e.g. `gpg -a -b <artifact>`, and upload
  the signatures to the draft release.
- Make a PR to update download links on https://tox.chat to point to the new
  release.
- Make a PR writing a short blog post for https://github.com/qTox/blog/.
- Make a PR on our [Flathub repository] copying the local manifest
  [`flatpak/io.github.qtox.qTox.json`] into the repository.
- Ensure the build passed for qTox on all architectures on
  [the Flathub build bot]

### Step 3. Publish and publicize the release

- Add a title and description to the draft release, then publish the release.
- Merge the [Flathub repository] PR.
- Merge the blog post PR and advertise the post on Tox IRC channels, popular
  Tox groups, reddit, or whatever other platforms.
